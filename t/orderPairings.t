=head3 DESCRIPTION

Order pairings in F1 order

The last criterion of the ranking of the higher-ranked player at the table is not tested so well perhaps. The test gives the ranking to the first player at the table.

I'm also wondering about the homomorphism from poset of scores of lower-scoring players to that of total scores.
