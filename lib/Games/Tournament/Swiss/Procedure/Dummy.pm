=head1 NAME

Games::Tournament::Swiss::Procedure::Dummy - A brain-dead pairing algorithm

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $tourney = Games::Tournament::Swiss->new( rounds => 2, entrants => [ $a, $b, $c ] );
 %groups = $tourney->formBrackets;
 $pairing = $tourney->pairing( \%groups );
 @pairs = $pairing->matchPlayers;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A test module swappable in to allow testing the non-Games::Tournament::Procedure parts of Games::Tournament::Swiss

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

 $pairing = Games::Tournament::Swiss::Procedure::Dummy->new(TODO \@groups );

Creates a stupid algorithm object that on matchPlayers will just pair the nth player with the n+1th in each score group, downfloating the last player if the number in the bracket is odd, ignoring the FIDE Swiss Rules. You can swap in this module in your configuration file, instead of your real algorithm to test the non-algorithm parts of your program are working.

sub new {
    my $self     = shift;
    my $index    = 0;
    my %args     = @_;
    my $round    = $args{round};
    my $brackets = $args{brackets};
    my $banner   = "Round $round:  ";
    for my $bracket ( reverse sort keys %$brackets ) {
        my $members = $brackets->{$bracket}->members;
        my $score   = $brackets->{$bracket}->score;
        $banner .= "@{[map { $_->id } @$members]} ($score), ";
    }
    print $banner . "\n";
    return bless {
        round    => $round,
        brackets => $brackets,
        matches  => []
      },
      "Games::Tournament::Swiss::Procedure";
}


=head2 matchPlayers

 @pairs = $pairing->matchPlayers;

Run a brain-dead algorithm that instead of pairing the players according to the rules creates matches between the nth and n+1th player of a bracket, downfloating the last player of the group if the number of players is odd. If there is an odd number of total players, the last gets a Bye.

=head2 brackets

	$pairing->brackets

Gets/sets all the brackets which we are pairing, as an anonymous array of score group (bracket) objects. The order of this array is important. The brackets are paired in order.

=cut

sub brackets {
    my $self     = shift;
    my $brackets = shift;
    if ( defined $brackets ) { $self->{brackets} = $brackets; }
    elsif ( $self->{brackets} ) { return $self->{brackets}; }
}


=head2 round

	$pairing->round

What round is this round's results we're pairing on the basis of?

=cut

sub round {
    my $self  = shift;
    my $round = shift;
    if ( defined $round ) { $self->{round} = $round; }
    elsif ( $self->{round} ) { return $self->{round}; }
}


=head2 matches

	$group->matches

Gets/sets the matches which we have made.

=cut

sub matches {
    my $self    = shift;
    my $matches = shift;
    if ( defined $matches ) { $self->{matches} = $matches; }
    elsif ( $self->{matches} ) { return $self->{matches}; }
}
