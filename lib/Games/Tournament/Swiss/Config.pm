=head1 NAME

Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config - Swiss Competition Configuration

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.03

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.03';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use constant ROLES => @Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config::roles = qw/Black White/;
    use constant ROLES => @Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config::ROLES;
    $Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config::firstRound = 11;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Actually, a swiss tournament is not just one kind of tournament, but a whole genre of tournaments. If you are using Games::Tournament::Swiss for other than chess tournaments, where the players take black and white roles, and score 0,0.5, or 1, for example, you probably want to configure it. You also might want to start swiss pairing at a random round in the tournament, in which case you will set firstround.

The roles, scores, firstround, algorithm methods in this module are here just to stop perl warning about 'only one use, possible typo' warnings, with the use of fully qualified Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config package variables. (Is that actually true? Anyway I want the methods (class and object) to return values, default and assigned.)

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Getter/setter of the genre of competition, eg chess, basketball, football, school exam, etc, the tournament is being held as.

=cut

sub new {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    $args{roles} ||= [ Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config->roles ];
    return bless \%args, $self;
}


=head2 frisk

Die if the configuration contains anything but [A-Za-z0-9:,.]

=cut

sub frisk {
    my $self    = shift;
    my @suspects = @_;
    for my $suspect ( @suspects )
    {
	unless ( ref $suspect ) {
	    die "We are afraid you may be importing nasty characters with
$suspect. Please use only [A-Za-z0-9:.,] in your configuration files"
	      unless $suspect =~ m/^[A-Za-z0-9:.,]*$/;
	}
	elsif ( ref($suspect) eq "ARRAY" ) {
	    for (@$suspect) { $self->frisk($_); }
	}
	elsif ( ref($suspect) eq 'HASH' ) {
	    for ( keys %$suspect ) { $self->frisk( $suspect->{$_} ); }
	}
	else {
	    die "We are afraid you may be importing nasty objects with $suspect.
Please use only arrays and hashes in your configuration files";
	}
    }
    return;
}


=head2 roles

Getter/setter of the roles the 2 players take, eg Black, White, or Home, Away. The default is White, Black. Both object and class method.

=cut

sub roles {
    my $self  = shift;
    my $roles = shift;
    if (ref $self eq "Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config" and $roles) {
        $self->{roles} = $roles; return;
    }
    if ( ref $self eq "Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config" and $self->{roles} )
    { return @{ $self->{roles} }; }
    else { return qw/White Black/; }
}


=head2 scores

Getter/setter of the scores the 2 players can get, eg win: 1, loss: 0, draw: 0.5, absent: 0, bye: 1, which is the default. Both object and class method.

=cut

sub scores {
    my $self   = shift;
    my $scores = shift;
    if (ref $self eq "Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config" and $scores)
    { $self->{scores} = $scores; }
    elsif (ref $self eq "Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config" and $self->{scores})
    { return %{ $self->{scores} }; }
    else { return ( win => 1, loss => 0, draw => 0.5, absent => 0, bye => 1 ) }
}


=head2 abbreviation

Getter/setter of the abbreviations used and their full translations. The default is W: White, B: Black, 1: Win, 0: Loss, '0.5': Draw, '=': Draw. Both object and class method.

=cut

sub abbreviation {
    my $self   = shift;
    my $abbreviation = shift;
    if (ref $self eq "Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config" and $abbreviation)
    { $self->{abbreviation} = $abbreviation; return; }
    elsif (ref $self eq "Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config" and
		$self->{abbreviation} )
    { return %{ $self->{abbreviation} }; }
    else { return ( W => 'White', B => 'Black', 1 => 'Win', 0 => 'Loss',
    0.5 => 'Draw', '=' => 'Draw', A => 'Absolute', S => 'Strong', M => 'Mild', ); }
}


=head2 algorithm

Getter/setter of the algorithm by which swiss pairing is carried out. There is no default. Pass a name as a string. I recommend Games::Tournament::Swiss::Procedure::FIDE. Make sure something is set.

=cut

sub algorithm {
    my $self      = shift;
    my $algorithm = shift;
    die "$algorithm name is like Games::Tournament::Swiss::Procedure::AlgoName"
      unless $algorithm =~ m/^Games::Tournament::Swiss::Procedure::\w+$/;
    if ($algorithm) { $self->{algorithm} = $algorithm; }
    elsif ( $self->{algorithm} ) { return @{ $self->{algorithm} }; }
}


=head2 firstround

Getter/setter of the first round in which swiss pairing started. Perhaps some other pairing method was used in rounds earlier than this. The default is 1. Both object and class method.

=cut

sub firstround {
    my $self       = shift;
    my $first = shift;
    if (ref $self eq "Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config" and $first)
    { $self->{firstround} = $first; }
    elsif (ref $self eq "Games::Tournament::Swiss::Config" and $self->{first} )
    { return @{ $self->{firstround} }; }
    else { return 1; }
}
